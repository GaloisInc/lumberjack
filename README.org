This is a logging facility.  Yes, there are many, and this is the one
with a beard, wearing flannel and boots, that gets the job done.  It's
not the fanciest, it doesn't have a cargo-van full of features.  This
logger is designed to be straightforward to use, provide a good set of
standard features, and be useable across a broad set of code.

 * Logging is a monadic activity.  This activity is most often
   performed in a monad stack with a MonadIO context to allow writing
   to files.

 * The specific logging action implementations are managed separately
   from the actions of logging messages in the target code.  This
   allows logging to be configurable and the manner of logging to be
   specified at startup time without requiring changes in the code
   from which log messages are being generated.

 * The logging implementation code can use cofunctors to adjust
   existing logging.

 * Main code will typically retrieve the logging actions from a Reader
   context in your monad stack.

 * The prettyprinter package is used for formatting.
